Delimited Table
===============

This one was a border table from which I removed the divider lines.

| Schema |         Name          |   Type   | Owner |
| public | actor_episodes        | view     | kat   |
| public | actors                | table    | kat   |
| public | copyable              | view     | kat   |
| public | episode_recording     | view     | kat   |
| public | episodes              | table    | kat   |
| public | episodes_title_id_seq | sequence | kat   |
| public | pal_recordings        | view     | kat   |
| public | recordings            | table    | kat   |
| public | sorted_eps            | view     | kat   |
| public | tapes                 | table    | kat   |
| public | unrecorded            | view     | kat   |
| public | wanting               | view     | kat   |

And this is a homegrown one.

:Fred:Nurk:lives:
:Kerr:Avon:is wonderfule:
::Servalan:has no first name:

And the next one has a caption, and a possibly tricky delimiter.

	     Actors
	& Paul & Darrow &
	& Jackie & Pierce &

Note that a CSV table doesn't work for delimiter stuff,
because it isn't *bounded* by commas.
