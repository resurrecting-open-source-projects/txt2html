<p>For Grand Falls E1 events (loss of service for a long time) huge
LOG files (200-300 thousand of lines) is a very typical and
complicating characteristics. Many process (SWERRs, TRAPs, INFOs,
etc) run in parallel and it is very important to understand what
caused what. I want to suggest some tips that can make easier
analysis of such log files.
 
</p><ol>
  <li>First of all learn ALL logs AT THE BEGINNING of the event.
   It is very important to understand what process began first.
   You should understand the meaning of EVERY log here.
 
  </li><li>Unix tool awk could be very useful for logs files processing.
   Here are some simplest examples of its using.
 
  <ol>
    <li>Cutting all logs of some definite type:
  </li></ol>
</li></ol>
<pre>
               awk '/PM189/,length &lt; 2' inp_file &gt; out_file
                       ^           ^
                       |           |
      Where:    Pattern in the   End condition
              first line of log  of log (empty string)
</pre>
 
<p> b) Cutting all lines BEFORE lines with some pattern:
 
</p><p>    awk '/INV CLASS/{print str;next}{str=$0}' inp_file &gt; out_file
</p><pre>
              ^          ^       ^      ^
       Where: |          |       |      |
              |     Output prev  |    Save full line
           Pattern     line    Go to
                              next line
</pre>
 
<p> c) Cutting all lines TWO lines BEFORE lines with some pattern:
 
</p><p>awk '/cp 35/{print str1;next}{str1=str;str=$0}' inp_file &gt; out_file
 
</p><p> d) Prepare exec for site in the form: QDN dn
</p><pre>
                                       QDN dn
                                       . . .
</pre>
 
<p> awk '/  DN /{print "QDN " $8}' inp_file | sort | uniq &gt; out_file
</p><pre>
          ^                 ^
 Where:   |                 |
          |           Field number in line
</pre>
<p>   Selection pattern  that contains dn
 
</p><p>3. If you need to answer question like that:
 
</p><p>   "What dn's that appear in logs of type A appear in logs of type B
   too ?" (For example, how many dn's that appear in AUDT203 logs
   appear in logs of TPTSWER cp 35 - inter integrity lost ?)
 
</p><p>   you could use the next procedure:
 
</p><ol>
  <li>Use 2a) for cutting all AUDT203 logs into one file and cp 35
       logs into another.
 
  </li><li>Use 2d) for producing of sorted list of dn's from these two
       new files.
 
  </li><li>Use tool comm in the form:
 
</li></ol>
<p>         comm dn_list1_file dn_list2_file &gt; out_file
 
</p><pre>
       and in the out_file you will see three columns - in the
       third one common dn's will appear.
</pre>
