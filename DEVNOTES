Developer Notes
===============

This uses Dist::Zilla for building/testing/release.

Changing the version
--------------------

1. Edit the dist.ini file to increment the version
2. Replace the old version number with the new version in the tfiles files.
3. "dzil test"

Generating README
--------------------------

Make the README changes in HTML/TextToHTML.pm
Dist::Zilla will generate the README from that.

Adding Options
--------------

All new options need to be added in five places:
- lib/HTML/TextToHTML.pm init_our_args(), to initialize the default
- lib/HTML/TextToHTML.pm args() in the parse-the-array-ref part, unless
  it is a simple option-with-a-value.  If it is a boolean option,
  it also needs to be added in its "no" form.
- lib/HTML/TextToHTML.pm OPTIONS documentation
- scripts/txt2html Getopt call, including its type and possible shortnames
- scripts/txt2html OPTIONS documentation

Changing the Global Link Dictionary
-----------------------------------

The contents of the global link dictionary are kept inside
lib/HTML/TextToHTML.pm in the __DATA__ section.
Any changes or updates to it must be done there.

Release Notes
=============

Before releasing, don't forget to run

	dzil test
	dzil build # for a sanity check of the build
	dzil release

(and usually "dzil install" as well)

This bundle was released in three different external places in early:
- CPAN
- Sourceforge
- FreshMeat

Currently, txt2html is available in GitHub.

CPAN Release
------------

Dist::Zilla will do the CPAN release as part of the release process.

Sourceforge Release
-------------------

Do a git push if you haven't already.

Go to the Admin/Files section and follow the instructions.
You will need to ftp upload the .tar.gz file to upload.sourceforge.net
/incoming directory before doing certain steps.

One also needs to update the web-page.  Cd to txt2html/web/htdocs on
your home machine, and edit index.html to update the version number.
Then do
	make del_cpfiles
	make cpfiles
	make
        git add
	git commit
        git push
	cd ..
	make install

(The last copies it over with rsync)

One should also post a message to the txt2html mailing list.

FreshMeat Release
-----------------

Log in to freshmeat.net, and follow the instructions for new releases.
The "changes this release" will need to be a summary of the changes.
Since the file is on sourceforge, you won't need to alter the download
URL.
