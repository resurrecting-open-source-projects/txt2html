This is an example of mixed input, with a list with what shouldn't be bold.

- The '#' character can be used to introduce comment lines. Comments and
   lines that are empty or contain only whitespace are ignored.
- Pipe characters and newlines within fields and '#' at the begin of the
   first field of an entry must be escaped with a backslash ('\').
