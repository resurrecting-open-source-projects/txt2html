<p>   RISC in a robotics context stands for Reduced Intricacy in Sensing and
   Control.  But it shares the same philosophy as RISC computer design.
   The idea is to replace complicated manipulation and sensing steps with
   combinations of simple ones.  Industrial robotics research has focussed
   on anthropomorphism in the hope that once robots become sufficiently
   human-like, they will be able to solve all the tasks that they are
   currently incapable of doing.  This approach is seductive and has led
   researchers further and further away from the real problems that
   hinder the proliferation of robots in manufacturing.  The enthusiasm
   for robotics in industry which reached a peak in the mid 80's has all
   but disappeared after a protracted lack of progress on these problems.</p>
