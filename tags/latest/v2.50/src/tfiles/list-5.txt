Definition Lists
=================

A definition list comprises the following:

Term:
  The term part of a DL item is a word on a line by itself, ending
with a colon.
Definition:
  The definition part of a DL item is at least one paragraph following
the term.

  If one has more than one paragraph in the definition, the first line of
the next paragraph needs to be indented two spaces from where the term
starts, otherwise we don't know that it belongs to the definition.

This is a new, separate paragraph.

Mixed Lists
-----------

Yadda_Yadda:
  a) a meaningless term
  b) something which Fred Flinstone says
  c) something with lawn in it

Just to be clear, this is a paragraph.

* Here's some unordered things.
  Unordered:
    Something without order.
* Item 2 in the unordered list.

  Ordered:
    Something with order.

* This should be item 3 in the unordered list.
