<p><em>Why do I keep on having these bright ideas?</em> Miles wondered as he
crawled through the service tunnel.  It gave him uncomfortable
flashbacks to the time he'd crawled through the ducting on Aslund
station.  Though at least this time he didn't have Gregor to worry
about.  No, just lizard things, and the Doctor.  Now there was an
unknown quantity.  Sharp, yes, and knew too much about the wrong things,
but... <em>You are supposed to be a good judge of character, Miles,</em> he
thought to himself.  <em>It's a bit late to be second-guessing now.</em>

<p>Miles sat up straighter in the chair and checked the settings again.
The earbud in his ear had warmed to body-temperature, but it was still a
hard lump.  Part of him was gibbering <em>Aliens!  You're going to be
talking to aliens!</em> while another part of him was just getting
impatient, waiting for the Doctor to return.
