Developer Notes
===============

Changing the version
--------------------

1. Edit the version.txt file to increment the version
2. "moddevaid VERSION" (this changes the version in all the needed files)
3. "Build distclean"
4. "perl Build.PL"
5. "Build"
6. "Build test"

You need to rebuild the Build file because Module::Build sets the version
information when the Build file is built, rather than it being dynamic.

Generating TODO and README
--------------------------

Make the todo changes with devtodo (tda, tdd, todo etc).

moddevaid TODO >TODO

Make the README changes in HTML/TextToHTML.pm

moddevaid README >README

Adding Options
--------------

All new options need to be added in five places:
- lib/HTML/TextToHTML.pm init_our_args(), to initialize the default
- lib/HTML/TextToHTML.pm args() in the parse-the-array-ref part, unless
  it is a simple option-with-a-value.  If it is a boolean option,
  it also needs to be added in its "no" form.
- lib/HTML/TextToHTML.pm OPTIONS documentation
- scripts/txt2html Getopt call, including its type and possible shortnames
- scripts/txt2html OPTIONS documentation

Changing the Global Link Dictionary
-----------------------------------

The contents of the global link dictionary are kept inside
lib/HTML/TextToHTML.pm in the __DATA__ section.
Any changes or updates to it must be done there.

Release Notes
=============

Before releasing, don't forget to run

	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build dist

(and usually "Build install" as well)

This bundle is released in three different external places:
- CPAN
- Sourceforge
- FreshMeat

CPAN Release
------------

Log in to PAUSE, and browser-upload the .tar.gz file.  Simple, huh?

Sourceforge Release
-------------------

Do a CVS commit if you haven't already.

Go to the Admin/Files section and follow the instructions.
You will need to ftp upload the .tar.gz file to upload.sourceforge.net
/incoming directory before doing certain steps.

One also needs to update the web-page.  Cd to txt2html_web/htdocs on
your home machine, and edit index.html to update the version number.
Then do
	make del_cpfiles
	make cpfiles
	make
	cvs commit
	cd ..
	make install

(The last copies it over with rsync)

One should also post a message to the mailing list.

FreshMeat Release
-----------------

Log in to freshmeat.net, and follow the instructions for new releases.
The "changes this release" will need to be a summary of the changes.
Since the file is on sourceforge, you won't need to alter the download
URL.
